## Description:
`tipCalculator.py` is a simple Python script that calculates the total amount to be paid per person, including the tip. It prompts the user for the following inputs:
1. The total bill amount.
2. The percentage of the tip.
3. The number of people splitting the bill.

It then calculates the amount each person should pay and displays the result.

## Usage:
To use the script, run it in your terminal:
```bash
python tipCalculator.py
```

The script will prompt you for input, and based on your responses, it will calculate the tip and the total per person.

Example Output:
Enter the total bill: 100
Enter the tip percentage: 15
Enter the number of people: 4
Each person should pay: $28.75
How it works:
The user inputs the total bill, the desired tip percentage, and the number of people splitting the bill.
The script calculates the total tip by multiplying the bill by the tip percentage.
The total amount is divided by the number of people to calculate the amount each person should pay.
